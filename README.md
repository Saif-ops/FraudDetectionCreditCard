# Fraud Detection Streaming Application

## Overview

This repository contains a real-time fraud detection streaming application built using Apache Spark and AWS services. The application consumes transaction data from an AWS Kinesis stream, processes the data to identify suspicious transactions, and sends notifications via Amazon SNS.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of the following components:

1. **AWS Kinesis Data Stream**
   - Serves as the data source for incoming transaction records.
   - Each transaction contains details such as transaction ID, user name, card number, amount, timestamp, and location.

2. **Apache Spark Structured Streaming**
   - Processes streaming data in real-time.
   - Implements stateful aggregations to detect anomalies in transaction patterns.
   - Utilizes watermarking for handling late data.

3. **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
   - Sends notifications to subscribed endpoints (e.g., mobile devices) when suspicious transactions are detected.

4. **Checkpointing**
   - Stores intermediate processing results to ensure fault tolerance and allow recovery in case of failures.

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark**: For processing and analyzing streaming data.
- **AWS Kinesis**: For ingesting real-time data streams.
- **Amazon SNS**: For sending notifications based on detected anomalies.
- **Python**: The programming language used to implement the streaming application.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with access to Kinesis and SNS services.
- Apache Spark environment set up (e.g., AWS EMR, local installation).
- Python 3.x with the following libraries installed:
  - `boto3`
  - `pyspark`

### Configuration

1. **AWS Credentials**:
   - Ensure your AWS credentials are configured, either through environment variables or the AWS CLI.

2. **Kinesis Stream**:
   - Create a Kinesis stream named `transaction_stream`.
   - Ensure it is active and able to receive data.

3. **SNS Topic**:
   - Create an SNS topic named `Fraud_delivery`.
   - Subscribe your mobile number or endpoint to the SNS topic to receive notifications.

4. **Checkpoint Location**:
   - Choose an S3 bucket to use for checkpointing. Ensure the bucket is accessible to your Spark application.

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Submit the Spark job using `spark-submit`:
   ```bash
   spark-submit Fraud_detection_streaming_job.py
   ```

3. Monitor the console logs for output and notification messages.

## Functionality

- The application continuously reads transaction data from the Kinesis stream.
- It analyzes transactions to identify patterns of fraud based on:
  - Multiple transactions from different locations within a short time frame.
  - High frequency of transactions in a short period.
- Notifications are sent to subscribed SNS endpoints with details of the suspicious transactions.

## Error Handling and Debugging

- Errors during processing will be logged in the console.
- Ensure that the Spark job has sufficient resources to handle incoming data.
- Check SNS subscription status if notifications are not received.
